List of Changes & Improvements
==============================

This server attempts to emulate the [Keldon Hanabi server](http://keldon.net/hanabi/). However, it also contains many new features, bug fixes, and quality of life improvements.

<br />

<br />



## New Major Features

#### Bottom Deck Blind Plays

* On your turn, if there is 1 card left in the deck, you are allowed to blind play it.
* This is done by dragging the deck on to the play area.
* A golden border will appear around the deck when there is 1 card left in order to signify that this is possible.
* This feature prevents stupid losses that occur from being "bottom decked" by a 3 or a 4 that was impossible to save in the early or mid-game.

#### Shared Replays

* Any replay can be started as a 'shared' replay. Once created, an unlimited number of people can join it.
* When in a shared replay, the leader can control what turn is being shown to everyone in the replay.
* The leader can click a card to highlight it with a red arrow.
* You can see who the leader of the replay is by hovering over the "ðŸ‘‘" icon in the bottom right-hand corner.
* You can use this feature to share a past game with a friend who was not in that game.

#### Timed Games

* Each game now has the option to be created with as a "Timed Game".
* Similar to chess, each player has a bank of time that decreases only during their turn.
* By default, each player starts with 5 minutes.
* Upon performing a move, each player will add 10 seconds to their clock.
* If time runs out for any player, the game immediately ends.
* In non-timed games, the timers will still show, but they will count up instead of down to show how long each player is taking.

#### Notes

* You can right-click a card to add a note to it.
* Since notes are tracked by the server, you can switch computers mid-game and keep your notes.
* Your notes will persist into the replay.
* Everyone's notes are combined and shown to spectators, which is fun to see.

#### Forced Chop Rotation

* Each game now has the option to be created with as "Forced Chop Rotation".
* If enabled, each player will automatically reorder their cards in the following algorithmic fashion:
  * After you discard or clue, if all the people between you and the last person who discarded played cards, then you move your right-most unclued card to the left-most position.

#### Color-Blind Mode

* Each player can toggle
* For players who are color-blind, this mode will make the game much easier to play by drawing the letters of the color on top of the card.

<br />



## New Sounds

* The sound for reaching your turn is improved.
* There is a new sound whenever someone else performs an action.
* There is a custom sound for a failed play.
* There is a custom sound for a blind play.

<br />



## Keyboard Shortcuts

* For the lobby:
  * Create a table: `Alt + c`
  * Show history: `Alt + h`
  * Start a game: `Alt + s`
  * Leave a table: `Alt + l`
  * Return to tables: `Alt + r`
* For in-game:
  * Play a card: `a` or `+` (will prompt an alert for the slot number)
  * Discard a card: `d` or `-` (will prompt an alert for the slot number)
  * Clue:
    * `Tab` to select a player
    * `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5` for a number clue
    * Or `q`, `w`, `e`, `r`, `t` for a color clue
    * Then `Enter` to submit
* For in a replay:
  * Rewind back one turn: `Left`
  * Fast-forward one turn: `Right`
  * Rewind one full rotation: `[`
  * Fast-forward one full rotation: `]`
  * Go to the beginning: `Home`
  * Go to the end: `End`

## Bug Fixes

* Games will no longer randomly crash if there are too many spectators.
* Your hand will be properly revealed at the end of the game.

<br />



## Quality of Life Improvements

* The way clues are represented on cards has been changed:
  * The cards that will be affected by a clue are represented by white arrows.
  * When a card has been touched by one or more clues, it will have a yellow border.
  * The possibilities of what a card can be are directly shown on the card.
* The action log is improved:
  * It will show what slot a player played or discarded from.
  * It will show "(blind)" for blind plays.
  * It will shows "(clued)" when discarding clued cards.
  * It will show 3 actions instead of 1.
  * It will show how many cards were left in the deck at the start of each message. (This only occurs when you click on it to see the full log.)
  * At the end of the game, it will show how much time each player had left. Or, in non-timed games, it will show how much time they took in total.
* The clue log will still continue to function if you mouse over played and discarded cards.
* The "No Clues" indicator is much easier to see.
* In-game replays will show card faces based on your current knowledge of the card.
* Replays of other games will no longer show "Alice", "Bob", etc., and will instead show the real player names. This way, if you have a question about what they did, you can actually message them and ask.
* Upon refreshing the page, if you are in the middle of the game, you will be automatically taken into that game from the lobby.
* You will no longer have to refresh the page after resizing the browser window.
* The "Clues" text on the game UI will be red while at 8 clues.
* Each suit name is listed below the stack in the middle of the screen during games with the multi-color variants.
* All lobby chat will be replicated to (and from) the Hanabi Discord server.
* The ambiguous checkboxes in the lobby have been converted to a "Status" indicator, showing exactly what the person is doing.
  * The possible statuses are as follows: Lobby, Pre-Game, Playing, Replay, Shared Replay, Spectating
* During a game, you can mouse over the "ðŸ‘€" icon in the bottom right-hand corner to see who is spectating the game.
* The username box on the login box will now be automatically focused and you can press enter to login.
* When you create a game, the server will suggest a randomly generated table name for you.
* The fade time has been shortened to 200 milliseconds (from 800 milliseconds) in order to make the UI snappier.
* Your name will be bolded in the user list.
* The UI has been cleaned up a little to make it look less cramped.
